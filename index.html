            <p> Formerly a teacher math and science teacher, a few years ago I 
                transitioned into software engineering. I enjoy solving technical 
                problems in pursuit of a shared organizational mission, but still 
                retain a love of teaching and mentoring younger engineers.

            <p>I am currently employed at

                a startup located in Rapid City, South Dakota. We make software
                which simplifies the maintenance process for property management
                companies.

                        <p>
                            I am a full-stack engineer at Property Meld. We are a small enough
                            company that everyone gets to wear many hats - I've built features,
                            managed infrastructure, improved our local development environment
                            and CI/CD pipeline, served as the support escalation, met with
                            customers and more.  Here are some highlights:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                            Served as tech lead on a redesign project.  This project
                            had dual aims of delivering consistent and excellent UI/UX and improving
                            developer velocity. I created a library of shared react
                            components which were easy for developers to use and 
                            also kept them on the happy path of adhering to our 
                            style guidelines.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Maintained and improved our local development environment,
                                which supported both Macs and Linux machines, and which
                                consisted of containerized (using Docker) versions of 
                                our various key services (such as our Django web server,
                                Celery task queue and its associated workers, Elasticsearch
                                and Kafka producers and consumers)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Informally mentored younger engineers on the team.  
                                Though I haven't been a software engineer long I have
                                found that my experience in the classroom has been 
                                invaluable in communicating with others.

                        <p>
                        A longtime computer hobbyist, I fell into IT over a decade ago when I figured out how to print to
                        the copy machine and set
                        all the other teachers up to do the same. Since then I've continually learned more about computer
                        technology up and down the stack.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                        I'm comfortable with JavaScript/TypeScript and Python, and I've dabbled in Go and Rust. I've used
                        several AWS services,
                        and am interested in serverless applications, DevOps, internal tooling and application performance.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            My current hobby project is <a href="https://github.com/martin-anderson-graham/prediction-ledger" target="_blank" class="article-link">
                                prediction-ledger
                            </a>, a TUI written in Rust I can use to track my predictions
                            and my prediction accuracy over time - for should we not
                            judge those who make predictions on whether they
                            came true?

                            It is built using

                            </a>, and I plan to use it to explore SQLite, WASM and leptos.
