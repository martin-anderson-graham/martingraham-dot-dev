	<p id="about-content">
    I'm a software engineer located in wonderful <a target="_blank" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waco,_Texas"> Waco Texas</a>.  I enjoy back-end programming, as making things works has always been satisfying to me.  I was a teacher and solo IT department in a small school for over a decade.  In my spare time I like to tinker with microcontrollers (ask me about my <a target="_blank" href="https://dan-in-ca.github.io/SIP/">drip irrigation system</a>), tend to my beehives (ask me about resisting the urge to run away from bees) and play table tennis (ask me about how it is <a target = "_blank" href="https://www.ittf.com/handbook/">not the same</a> things as ping pong)
